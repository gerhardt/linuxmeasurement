This is a directory which contains the nudaq driver in a version for a 2.6
kernel. It seems to work with a co16 program up to full card bandwidth.

The driver should work with dynamically allocated major device numbers, and
the loader script should create the relevant device file, while the unloader
script removes the device files and unloads the module.

The loading framework is still a bit rudimentary....the load/unload routines
are only intended for manual use for debugging. Plesae use the "nudaqcard"
framework in one directory above to insert a generic module.
