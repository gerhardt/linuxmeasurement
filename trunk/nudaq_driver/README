This directory structure should contain the driver for a nudaq PCI7200 card
which is compatible both with a 2.4 kernel and a 2.6 kernel. It should compile
a driver, and install a loader script in the traditional (i.e., non-hotplug)
way via an entry in the /etc/init.d startup directory.


Files:
README:  This file
Makefile:  compiles/installs a loader for the respective kernel version
nudaqcard.loadersource: skeleton to create a loader file to be copied
           into the /etc/init.d tree, which then loads the driver at the
           system startup. In order to activate the loader, it has to be
	   marked in the runlevel editor.
2.4/ndd2.4-3.c: kernel version 2.4 driver
2.4/makefile
2.6/ndd2p6.c: kernel verision 2.6 driver
2.6/makefile

Compilation:
The driver is compiled from this directiry with

make clean (if necessary)
make all

Installation:

(as root): make install

Then, the runlevel editor can be used to mark the "nudaqcard" loader as active
e.g. in runlevel 5, and started from there as well.
