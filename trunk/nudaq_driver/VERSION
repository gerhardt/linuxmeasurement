minor patch to make the code running on kernels >2.6.23 or so due to obsoleted
nopage method. Still needs heavy cleanup and testing.

This device driver is starting to get problematic in its way it shares direct
DMA writable memory pages with user space programs using the mmap method. I
saw problems arising with kernels used in suse releases >10.0. Up to Suse
10.0 (kernel version 2.6.??) it works fine.

Use with care in newer versions, system crashes after a few hours of usage
have been seen.

Origin of the problem seems to be a revamp of the page handling section in the
kernel memory management, I had to abuse privileged code manipulating
individual page entries in multipage clusters to prevent swapping following
the nopage scenario described in the kernel driver book by alessandro rubini

IRQ_request parameters and irq handler parameters updated. Still not clear how
stable code works with 2.6 kernel
