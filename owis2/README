This is a unified driver/applications directory.

Drivers are contained in the OS-version specific directories (2.4 or 2.6),
and a few applications are in the apps directory. The devstuff holds a loader
script.

How to make everything:
Say "make" in this directory, and it compiles driver, apps and a loader
script, which can be (as su) installed via make install.

The loader script must be activated with a runlevel editor.



files in 2.4 directory:


sm32_kmodule.c	   source code of the device driver.
sm32_2.h	   header file containing all the definitions you need
		   talk to the driver with ioctl() commands
sm32_kmodule.o	   the compiled driver; can be manually inserted with insmod,
		   but see below for scripted insertion

files in the 2.6 directory:
sm32_kmodule.c	   source code
sm32_2.h	   extended version of the header file; contains a few more
		   ioctls.

applications:

stepmotor2.c:	   small program to count events with this card. 

Current state of the drivers:
2.4:    version which runs with a fixed major address, and can only handle
	one card

2.6:    dynamical major number, can handle up to 5 cards. Device files are
	automatically created and removed with card.
